<div class="demo-description">
<p>Restrict the range of selectable dates with the <code>minDate</code> and <code>maxDate</code> options.  Set the beginning and end dates as actual dates (new Date(2009, 1 - 1, 26)), as a numeric offset from today (-20), or as a string of periods and units ('+1M +10D').  For the last, use 'D' for days, 'W' for weeks, 'M' for months, or 'Y' for years.</p>
